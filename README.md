# IoTAutomaticPlantWatering
The goal of this project is to automate the plant watering, measuring the soil moisture sensor and activating the pump motor if the plant needs water.

The arduino will sleep 24 hours, then the sensor will read the value, and it will activate the pump motor if needed. Then, the microcontroller will sleep again.
